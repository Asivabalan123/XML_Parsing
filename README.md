# XML_Parsing
XML is Extensive Markup Language. XML is to transfer and store data consisting of children and parent nodes that holds the data in text format.

Start by installing the gems:
- rspec
- nokogiri

This project enabled us to practice testing an XML file, the nokogori gem allowed us to easily access to the XML path to get to a specific destination through different parent and children nodes.

To run the tests go into XMLLab and run rspec.
